      "text": "Cartopia Inn has been the point of origin for many fantastic tales, it sits before an ocean of possibilities. \n\nScholars say its mysterious powers are responsible for the raining of teeth in the Valley, the bubbling of magma at the Forge, and the wellbeing of life in Cartopia. \n\nNobody knows how the Inn came to be. It has been written that when people settled in the land of Cartopia, hundreds of moons ago, this Inn was found standing on a lonesome hill with no one inside. The aura its magic generates is tangible to anyone inside its black, wooden frame. Its existence allows for life in Cartopia. Mages have long found it useful for conjuring artificial crops, as the soil is poor in Cartopia. Moreover, it provides a large pool of magica from which combat mages may draw upon for power in battle, should the need ever arise for defense or brutality. \n\nAs you sip down a pint of honey-mead, you can't help but notice the mysterious, purple-hooded men talking in the corner of the Inn. They lean in closely to speak with one another, as if they are trying not to be heard. \n\nBecoming aware of your gaze, one of the men stares back at you before they make a hasty exit. The shorter of the two bumps into the doorframe on his way out. Just then a white and silver object slips out of his pants and onto the floor, unbeknownst to him. The steady croning of the bard's lute makes it impossible for the man to hear the item fall. Before the door closes, you hear one of the men mention meeting back up after he finshes an errand at the Magma Forge. \n\n\nWill you investigate the mysterious item, letting the men slip away?\nOr will you follow one of the men to Magma Forge?\n\n\n[[Investigate the Mysterious Item->Valley of Falling Teeth]]\n[[Follow the Man->Magma Forge]]\n",

      "text": "As you draw nearer to the object on the floor its edges begin to radiate a purple shine. You realize it is a key made of teeth, casted in silver. Torches on the wall illuminate the key's silver outlining. The flames dance inside its reflection, moving constantly and not moving at all. \n\nPicking up the key, you realize it is heavier than you thought, and of remarkable craftsmenship. Its handle is a silver troll skull, complete with the long teeth characteristic of trolls. Branching out from the handle, the arm of the key is composed of four lines of troll teeth, one for each side, cemented with silver. \n\nYou recognize those distincitive, pointy teeth from anywhere; you make your way straight to the Valley of Falling Teeth. \n\nFollowing a road from the Inn, you arrive where the cliffs part in the Earth. \n\nThe Valley of Falling Teeth is peppered with trolls of all variety: magma trolls, ice trolls, earth trolls, and cave trolls make their homes here. The trolls in Cartopia are animalistic. They cannot read, they cannot write, and if they have a language it is yet to be understood. Their eyes burn with a hot purple glow.\n\nThe Valley gets its name from its frequent teeth showers. Every sunrise is marked with the unexplainable raining of troll teeth from the heavens. Perhaps communication with the trolls could explain this phenomenon, but man and troll have long held a violent feud. Besides, it's not like there is much to be learned from animals anyway. \n\nUpon your arrival the key begins vibrating with a violent ferocity, as the purple light intensifies. You set up camp at the edge of the Valley so that you may await the men's reunion. The key seems to vibrate more furiously the closer you get to the caves in the East. \n\n\nWill you explore the Caves or wait for the men?\n\n\n[[Explore the Caves->Eastern Caves]]\n[[Wait for the Men->Secret Meeting1]]",

      "text": "Tossing the tavern-keeper a sack of coins, you jump to your feet and make a dash outside. Cartopia's tranquil nightfall provides you with the shade you require to remain undetected. \n\nUnder the diamond-polkadotted sky you follow behind as they walk from the Inn. Not a word is exchanged between the men as they marched together until the taller man announces his departure. \n\n\"Remember what I told you about the keys!\" he demanded to the shorter, hooded figure.\n\n\"Yes, yes... I know...\" replied the other, \"I understand what hangs in the balance.\" Something in his voice struck you as uncertain.\n\nThe taller figure responded \"Very well. We will reunite under the stars in the Valley of Falling Teeth. Soon our work shall be done.\"\n\nThe men part, and you trail behind the tall man while he journeys to Magma Forge.\n\nWhen you arrive at Magma Forge, you are once again stunned by its magnificence. Much like Cartopia Inn, the origins of Magma Forge are a mystery. The forge bubbles magma like a hole in the Earth, surrounded by buildings clad in expertly crafted metal pieces for sale. Its apparent permanence is often considered when scholars suggest its relation to Cartopia Inn. \n\nBeside the forge lies the blacksmith's main workshop. King murdering blades, troll slaying axes, and bridge building hammers of only the strongest variety have all been forged here. Such a forge functions not as a mere producer of fine tools, but as an angel blessing masterpieces, none of which even come close to utilizing the forge to its full potential. \n\nThe hooded man approaches a small hut behind the blacksmith's workshop and knocks three times. Behind the door you hear a strange, loud thumping sound marching to a specific rhythm, leaving a second long pause between each thump. Each thump progresses in volume until, finally, the rusty hinges of the door squeal in response to the violent thrashing open. \n\nAt the door stood a seven foot tall red cave troll, her eyes glowing blood red. A silver collar clung tightly around her neck, bearing a silver medallion which prominently exhibited two troll teeth, from the Valley no doubt. \n\nShe didn't move like a wild troll, she was heavy and slow in her kinesics, as if controlled. Her back slowly pressed against the wall, as she reached her arm out to beckon in the hooded man. She uttered one word: \"Master.\"\n\nTrolls do not speak. They are animals. Startled by this revelation, by this impossible scene playing out before you, you understand now that the hooded man is more than just a man. He is a mage.\n\nHe hurries through the entrance so quickly he doesn't secure it shut, and the cave troll ambles down the stairs behind him. You follow. The stairs bring you to a laboratory full of half-dissected trolls. The mage orders the cave troll to sit in the corner and wait for his next direction, she obeys. \n\nHe abruptly continues carving into the head of one of the poor, deceased, trolls. After casting a spell on the trolls head, causing it to glow green and hum in a sharp low pitch, the mage reached into its mouth and begins slowly pulling something out. Whatever it was, it slips and falls deeper into the poor creature. He will surely walk up the stairs and leave when he is finished fishing it out, to reunite with the other hooded man in the Valley of Falling Teeth. \n\n\nWill you break the medallion binding the cave troll or will you wait to see what the mage reveals?\n\n\n[[Break the Medallion->Troll Emancipation]]\n[[Watch the Mage->Secret Meeting2]]",

      "text": "With every step you take toward the caves in the east, the key glares brighter and brighter. The vibrating turns to jittering when you find yourself before a sheet of rock in the side of a soaring, orange cliff face. \n\nSomething isn't right, the winds are imperceptible. You hold your key up to the wall and it crumbles to dust, revealing a hidden passage deep into the ground. A ladder manifests before you, and you lean forward to gaze down the hole. \n\nDeep voices, the likes of which you have never known, reverberate through the stone and into your eardrums. The bass of their voices is unrelenting in its harsh vibrations, whoever is speaking has an unsuaully low pitch voice. \n\nYou fumble down the wooden steps, illuminated by your silver key. At the bottom you are greeted with a sight you never dreamed possible. \n\nHundereds of trolls, all looking straight at you, heavily armed, each and every one of them wearing some sort of magical olive green battle helmets. It becomes clear that you are in some sort of underground system of tunnels, the mouth of which you have just entered. At the entrance, visible to everyone, you feel naked. \n\n\nThese trolls are not like the trolls you are familiar with. It is clear from the many maps on the walls of the cave that they are adept in both reading and writing. They seem to have a languge, consisting at least of symbols which translate to sound when properly understood. What's more, their eyes are not burning with a purple gleam.\n\nOne of the trolls, an earth troll, walks gingerly to where you are standing and greets you in plain English. \"I understand that you may be alarmed... but if you are of good will, and of good faith, we mean no harm unto you.\"\n\nYou can't help but gasp. The very idea of trolls being capable of language is startling enough, let alone being capable of fluent English.\n\nHe continues, \"Yes, I know. Shocking, is it not?\" The troll's sarcasm amazes you, you are dumbfounded by your ignorance. \"A lowley troll capable of reading, capable of thinking, capable of not being a slave.\" The anger in his voice is muted by a sort of patience for your not understanding. \"Let me ask you this, in earnest, did you know us trolls came before your people? This, as you call it, 'Cartopia Inn' on which you animals have become so dependant for your magic. Have you ever stopped to wonder where it came from?\" \n\nRecalling the narrative of local scholars, you explain that you have wondered, but have not ever found an answer. You explain that scholars associate it with Magma Forge for thier baffling old age. \n\nThe troll exhaled, rested his hand on his forehead, and took a long pause to contemplate what he just heard. \"You are partially correct. Those places are the same age. They were created at the same time. By the same people. By us!\" He paused. \"The entire infrastructure of Cartopia is dependent on our creations, and our subjucation. When your bastard mages arrived they used two magical keys to perform a ritual that turned the power of our temple, which you mistake for an inn, against us. We were cursed to animal-like intelligence for eons, while your people prospered, ignorant of all that came before you.\" \n\nHe notices you staring up at his helmet. \"Ah, yes. You see this? It is made of an ancient copper, green with wisdom. All troll armies used to wear such helments, until your people arrived. The mages presented us with 'gifts' of silver. We traded with them peacefully, and at first we gladly accepted their silver baubles. Until the day they took the temple from us. Silver bears alchemical powers us trolls were unaware of, it made our defeat all too certain. Our defeat marked the beginning of our cursed history, living under a people who owe us everything.\"\n\nThe earth troll's speech was interrupted by an explosion outside which rumbled through the cave. \"It is beginning!\" one of the trolls shouted. \"Quickly, it is time!\" \n\nSuddenly the mass of trolls before you dissapears. They funnel out of innumerable exit points, flooding the valley. You follow them out and watch them surround the strange men which led you here in the first place. Thunder shreds the sky. Purple and red branches of lightning turn the marble sky into a horrible canvas, illustrating war. Remembering what the troll said about magical keys, and seeing this biblical event as no coincidence, you reach into your pocket and grab the fabled silver key.\n\n\nDo you give the mages your silver key, preserving life in Cartopia as you know it by killing the entire troll population?\nOr do you give the trolls your key, throwing fuel onto the flames of thier revolution?\n\n\n[[Give the Key to the Mages->Save Mankind1]]\n[[Give the Key to the Trolls->Save Trollkind1]]",

      "text": "You strain yourself watching the mage as he reaches his entire arm into the mouth of the deceased troll. His arms emerge, covered in a cold, transparent slime. Some sort of golden troll skull appears in the mage's hands. A smile creeps along his grey face, accompanied by a single tear, then laughter. \n\n\"Do you see this, swine?\" he chortles at the red cave-troll. \n\nShe dutifly replies, \"Yes, master.\" Her voice is an octive deeper than his, and many eons older. \n\n\"Tonight you trolls will get what you deserve, an event centuries in the making!\" the pride in his voice is tangible. \"Much like your once useless forge, and much like your once useless inn, tonight your useless valley will at last find purpose. For far too long we have allowed your kind to pollute our land!\"\n\n\"This was once our land, master.\" Her words cut through him like a thousand knives. The idea of being entirely dependant on the everything trolls created is a sour truth for the mage to swallow. \n\nIn a fit of rage he screams \"Silence!\" He then continues, \"It is our land now. It has been our land ever since we took the inn and used it to curse you all to dog like intelligence. You being the only exception, of course, because you are such a useful pawn to me. We shall end your purid falling of teeth, which stunts any sort of civilized agricultural progress we could ever hope to achive here in Cartopia. Do you understand how hard it is to cultivate enough crops for a people when it is raining damned troll teeth on the soil?\" \n\n\"But master, we cannot surive without the falling of teeth. To us trolls, it is not only sacred, but it is what binds us to this realm.\" Her voice suggests that she knows what he is going to say next.\n\nThe mage stood direclty before the cave troll's ancient face. \"You are damned to be the last of your kind. Mark my words troll.\"\n\nA clink sound echoes throughout the room when the mage places the golden troll skull into the handle of a golden key, lined with troll teeth. Just then its edges began to glow a harsh, violent red. Stuffing the magical key into his robe pocket, the mage starts upstairs again. Before making his ascent he orders the cave troll into a box on the floor, immeidately beside the corpse he was working on. You shuffle into a nook in the hut's wall and wait for the mage to pass. \n\nAfter he passes, you take another moment to examine the horrifying laboratory. Its walls bear a flag you've never seen before, a white background with innumerable black dots moving in a downward motion. You recognize the scene, it is the falling of teeth. \n\nYou notice that the cave troll has been studying you, as you study its flag. \"Take it\" she says. \"Preserve the memory of my people, you must.\" You nod your head, picking up the flag before ripping the medallion off of her neck. \"Thank you, you have shown a kindness today us trolls do not know from your people.\"\n\nYou exit, once again hiding in the bushes so as to watch the mage undetected. As planned, the mage marches to the the Valley of Falling Teeth with you trailing closely behind. \n\nYou arrive at the Valley of Falling Teeth; upon arrival the mage's key begins vibrating with a violent ferocity, as its red light intensifies. \n\nThe mage reunites with the shorter man and presents the golden key. They create a fire and perform some sort of ceremony around it, involving the sprinkling of various herbs. Suddenly the sky becomes furious with a golden and silvery storm, hurling murderous red and purple lightning bolts down into the valley. A beam of harsh magenta glowers down onto the caves in the east, exposing a hole in the rocks.\n\nWhen the men arrive at the hole in the cliff, they are greeted by a deluge of trolls wearing olive green helmets. These trolls are unlike any wild trolls you have ever seen before. These trolls, like the troll from the forge, speak. They seem to have organized an attack anticipating the destruction of their kind. It is clear that thier magical armor somehow subverts the curse which has plagued their people since the arrival of mages in Cartopia, and indeed all human magic.\n\nThe mages dash away in a frenzy, hundereds of trolls following behind. You watch the mages begin to panic, this is not what they planned. The shorter mage searches his pockets frantically for something, you're not sure what, while the other attempts to begin a ritual with his golden key.\n\nSuddenly it dawns on you... the silver object from Cartopia Inn. Perhaps it too was a key.\n\nAt once the mages spot you from across the valley, they head straight for you almost instinctively. Everyone present knows that if something is not done soon the hundereds of surrounding trolls will devour all three of you. They descend like inverted flames, armed with spears and hatchets. It was clear by the mages' robes that they are not battle mages, but instead something akin to scientists. They will not be able to repel the assault. You recall the troll flag you retrieved from Magma Forge. The trolls haven't seen this flag in ages, it could prove a powerful tool in deceiving them to stop their assault. \n\n\nWill you raise the flag to fool the trolls, buying the mages enough time to recover the silver key and banish the trolls forever?\nOr will you keep the flag hidden, letting the trolls devour all three of you, thus ensuring the survival and emancipation of the troll race?\n\n[[Raise the Flag->Save Mankind2]]\n[[Hide the Flag->Save Tollkind2]]",

      "text": "You reach down from the steps and grab hold of the cave troll's medallion while the mage is distracted, giving it a strong tug. The silver chain snaps under the pressure. Your eyes meet with the cave troll's; the fiery red glow of her eyes simmer into a cool, human autumn. Like leaves her eyes shift from red to golden brown. \n\nAs if a dam broke somewhere deep in the troll's mind, somewhere hurting, she unleashes a torrent of vengeful blows on her former-slaver. Launching herself from the wall, her heavy red limbs descend on the man. She pins him to the ground and you look away, not wanting to see what happens next. Between screams and loud crunches the mage swiftly meets his demise. The cave troll lifts her face from the new cavity in his chest and fixes her eyes on yours once again. \n\n\"Words cannot express my deep gratitude for your empathy and bravery this day.\" Her now perfectly articulated English is hard for you to comprehend. A troll conversing with a human was impossible to you only moments ago. \"I have been that mage's slave for many moons, and us trolls have been slaves to mages even longer.\" \n\nLooking back down at the mangled mage, she utters, \"But soon this shall change...\" Her eyes meet yours again, \"I imagine you are quite confused by all of this; I shall not hold it against you. For what you have done, I owe you an explanation at the very least.\" \n\nYou watch the cave troll lift her heavy frame to a full standing position. The more life like motions of her newly freed body provide you both with a sense of comfort. \n\nShe continues, \"The majority of Cartopians have been deceived by your wicked mages. You were fed a false narrative which left you unaware of your dominance, something only trolls and mages have to know. You see, I am no miracle; I am not an unusual troll for my intelligence. We all enjoyed this level of intelligence before the arrival of your species to this land. We crafted the marvelous temple which makes life in this barren crescent possible, the temple you now know as 'Cartopia Inn'. The temple is also what churns the bubbling earth of Magma Forge so infinitely. The deep well of magica within the temple was the result of generations of troll brilliance, research, and hard work. Yes, we trolls only connote savagery because of the injustice done to us.\" The muscles in her jaw tighten slightly, yet perceptibly, the painful truth stinging her memory. \"When the mages arrived we traded with them. They subsequently introduced us to the gorgeous, dangerous, metal you know to be 'silver'. This generosity was short lived, for the mages enchanted the silver with a magic unknown to trolls. After we unknowingly accrued enough silver from the mages for their evil-plan to succeed, they overtook the temple and used its sacred powers against us. We were cursed, confounded to the minds of animals, and branded with purple flaming eyes. After our great defeat we were banished to the Valley of Falling Teeth, where we have remained ever since.\"\n\nA cold sensation prickles your toes. You peer down at your boots and learn that the pool of blood surrounding the mage has been gradually expanding. \"The mage you have just witnessed me slaughtering spared me from this fate, condemning me to his personal servitude. Though my intelligence remained intact, my dignity did not.\" A tear rolls down her muscular cheek and onto the cold stoney floor. \"His medallion made me obedient, not stupid.\" She pauses before starting again, \"For years I have obeyed his every command... But even under such a precarious circumstance, us trolls are cunning. On a day long excursion to the Valley of Falling Teeth several years ago I enacted my sole act of resistance.\" \n\nHer eyes dialate as she shares her story. \"The mage was researching a strange aura of magic originating from the Eastern Caves. His fingers produced a portal on the face of the cliff containing the caves. He made me enter the portal to see if it was safe, like a canary. I did so and the portal vanished. Inside I found cursed trolls living among each other, and an ancient golden chest. Seizing the opportunity before me I opened the chest to discover the green copper helmets of old. These troll battle helmets are enchanted with a magic which grants the wearer immunity to foreign magic. Thus, the cosmic balance shifted. I gave a helmet to a troll that became the first free troll to exist since the fall of our society. The spell was undone, and he promised to be the spark we need to set ablaze the ties which bind us. I have been waiting for that day to come ever since.\"\n\nThe troll's words unveil a series of startling truths. You ask her how she claims to know that the subjugation of trolls is coming to an end. After all, man has dominated this land for centuries. She informs you that she knows because she will make it so. She plans on returning to the Eastern Caves to emancipate her fellow trolls using the enchanted copper battle helmets, and then launching an attack on Cartopia. She promises to kill every last human in Cartopia. You and anyone you love will be spared, she says, for your brave defiance. You are faced with an impossible decision.\n\n\n\nWill you inform Cartopia of the coming slaughter, allowing the mages enough time to prepare a ritual capable of expelling the trolls from this dimension to their deaths?\nOr will you join the troll resistance, at the cost of every human life in Cartopia besides yourself and the people you love? \n\n\n[[Join the Trolls->Save Trollkind4]]\n[[Warn the Men->Save Mankind4]]\n\n",

      "text": "Hours pass as you await the mysterious men. You start a blaze to keep yourself warm in cool night air. The silver troll key buzzes in such a constant drone that it sonically disolves into the atmostphere around you; it becomes one of the world's many backround noises. It could be locusts, it could be trees, maybe it is part of the winds. You feel assured by its buzzing. Surely this all means something, you think to yourself. But what? The key's reaction to the valley is obviously not coincidental. But why is it so? \n\nLost in deep contemplation, you draw your copper flask and take a sip of the firey liquid it contains. Setting aside your flask, it brushes gently against the silver key. This prompts a loud burst of magical energy, purple and red. The pulse rings out through the valley, launching you five feet into the air. You land hard on the rocky ground, your temple bouncing off the stone. Everything is white now. Now it's black. Now everything is gone. \n\nYou wake up, who knows how much later, to a flashing angry sky. You feel like such a fool. Everyone knows to keep enchanted silver away from copper, for copper reacts alchemically to such silver. Jagged coils and sprawling branches of red and violet lightning strew the marble canvas sky. A beam of harsh magenta glowers down onto the caves in the east, exposing a hole in the rocks. You hear confused shouting from behind you, faint under the rupturous thunder. It is the men you were waiting for.\n\nWhen the purple-hooded men reunite one of them presents the other with a key. It appears identical to the silver troll key you currently possess. This key, however, is crafted from gold and emits a velvety red light. It must be the so called 'errand' which compelled the man to visit Magma Forge. \n\nEverything is red under the living, oppressive sky. It flexes like a fleshy lung. The moment you have been waiting for is finally upon you. You aproach the hooded men and demand answers for their meddling with nature. They recognize you from Cartopia Inn and insist on secrecy. To catalize their cooperation with you, you pull out your copper flask and hold it close to the silver key. Their eyes grow wide; it is clear that they are mages, and that they understand the threat you pose to them.\n\n\"So be it, commoner.\" the taller one says. \"My name is Aurelius, the mystic slaver of trolls. Beside me is my underling companion, Cicero of Cartopolis.\" Cicero nodded. \"We convene on this day to prevent a great cataclysm,\" he gestures his left arm up to the sky. \"Behold, commoner. Today you witness the sealing of dimensions. Cartopia Inn, are you aware of it's significance?\"\n\nYou shake your head, growing irritated with his condescention. You explain that you understand it is quite ancient, and perhaps related to the forge, but nothing more.\n\n\"Yes, this is to be expected of common folk. I shall not chide you for your ignorance, but I must admit you have been well decieved indeed\" he replies. \"This is by design, of course. Now I shall tell you the story scholars erased from history: our triumph over the trolls. When we Cartopians arrived in this land, it was plagued by the troll population. They were not the trolls you know today, however, these trolls were much more dangerous. Capable of reading, writing, strategizing, free will, and most importantly they understood the cosmic forces of magic. This understanding of magic is what prevented us from making our democracy here in the first place. We could never infiltrate their temple because it barred us from entry, through the means of a discriminatory magical barrier which only allowed trolls to enter. We mages knew what could be gained by taking such a powerful source of magic and using it for our own purposes. Thus, we traded cursed silver to the filthy animals. They accepted our gifts like trojan horses. You see, they were not familiar with the alchemical properties of silver. When silver jewelry and baubles found their way into the temple, it was all too easy to take the temple for ourselves. On the day ancient mages remember as the 'Rise of Cartopolis', the cursed silver was used to hypnotize all the trolls you know, damning them eternally with purple, firey eyes and the intelligence of dogs. Such was the birth of this utopia. Expanding our population was no challenge after we captured the temple and bade the trolls to the valley. Their infinite bank of magica is what allowed us to cultivate farms here; it is what allows us to defend ourselves; it is what allows us to control the trolls; and it is what makes the forever burning magma churn in the ancient forge. This land may have been built by trolls, but it belongs to man. It shall always belong to man. Through the fabled two key ritual, tonight you will witness the end of their kind. The longevity of Cartopia will be made concrete, our way of life forever preserved.\"\n\n\nIt takes you a moment to comprehend everything you just learned. Your entire life, you lived not knowing what created the grounds you walk on. Suddenly, the storm haults, but the sky remains at war. It is frozen still in it's position. \n\n\"It is time\" Aurelius says. \"Come with us. Come make history with us.\" You begin marching with the men to where a magenta beam lands on the Earth, to the Eastern Caves.\n\nWhen you arrive with the men they are surpised by a deluge of trolls wearing olive green helmets. These trolls are unlike any wild trolls you have ever seen before. These trolls speak to each other. They seem to have organized an attack anticipating the destruction of their kind. It is clear that thier magical helmets somehow subvert the curse which has plagued their people since the arrival of mages in Cartopia, and indeed all human magic. You catch a glimpse into the people the trolls were before mages dubbed them animals and obscured thier history. You don't see animals now, now you see people. \n\nYou dash away with the mages in a frenzy, hundreds of trolls following behind. The mages begin to panic, this is not what they planned. The sky resumes its wretched gurgle. \n\n\"The key!\" Aurelius calls to you, reaching out his hand as you run together. \"I need both keys to complete the banishment! You gave me your word!\" The trolls are everywhere, if you do not give the mage the fabled silver key soon you all will die. \n\nWill you give Aurelius the silver key, banishing trolls from existence forever?\nOr will you lauch the key skyward, letting the trolls devour the three of you to save thier kind?\n\n\n[[Give Aurelius the Key->Save Mankind3]]\n[[Launch the Key Skyward->Save Tollkind3]]",

They were deeply moved by this gesture, pausing thier charge and giving the mages enough time to work thier silver tongues. They professed a string of lies, asserting that peace and emancipation are what inspired their visit to the Valley that day. The trolls were eventually convinced that the mages had come to undo the ancient spell, as the mages claimed to have learned that their treatment of the trolls was cruel and unjust. One of the mages asked to leave so he could retreive what he needed for the spell, the trolls held you and the other mage as hostage to ensure his return. And return he did, with the silver key of old. At once the trolls, believing that they had finally arrived at emancipation, watched the very ritual which doomed their fate forever. You saved your own life, the mages, and perhaps even the people of Cartopia (who were none the wiser). Life in Cartopia hardly changed for you after the fact. Only you and the mages share the knowledge of exactly what occured that fateful evening. \n",
