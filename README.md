The Fall of Cartopia is a largely narrative focused game which encourages multiple play-throughs for the full experience. To reiterate, the story is often delivered specifically to deceive the player, thus one play through is not enough to expose the entire narrative. It is HIGHLY recommended to play through at least two different branches. Every decision the player makes impacts the ending they will receive, as well as the perspectives from which the lore of Cartopia is delivered. Each branch in the narrative not only offers a unique plot experience, but also a unique lens through which to examine the plot. I hope you enjoy!
